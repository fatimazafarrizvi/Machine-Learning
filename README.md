# 🧠 Medical Cost Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a **Machine Learning model from scratch** in Python to predict **medical insurance costs** based on various features such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and more.

The focus is not just on implementation but on **understanding the mathematical intuition** behind **Linear Regression** and **Gradient Descent**, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about patients and their corresponding medical charges. Each row includes:

- Age
- Sex
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
- Insurance Charges

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- ✅ Implemented **Linear Regression** and **Gradient Descent** from scratch using **NumPy**
- 🧮 Focused on **mathematical intuition** and **manual derivation** of the loss function and gradients
- 📉 Optimized using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the cost function
- 📈 Visualized cost convergence over iterations
- 🔄 Applied **feature scaling** and **normalization** for faster convergence
