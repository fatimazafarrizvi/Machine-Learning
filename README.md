ðŸ§  Medical Cost Prediction using Linear Regression
This project explores a Machine Learning model using Linear Regression and Gradient Descent in Python to predict medical insurance costs based on factors like age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights:
Implemented from scratch using NumPy (no ML libraries like scikit-learn).

Focused on understanding the mathematical intuition behind Linear Regression and Gradient Descent.

Worked with a real-world dataset to model and minimize the cost function (Mean Squared Error).

Included data visualization and preprocessing steps for deeper insight.

ðŸ“š Skills Learned:
Gradient Descent algorithm and convergence analysis

Loss function (MSE) implementation

Feature scaling & data normalization

Visualizing cost function across iterations
